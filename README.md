# Task Management System

## Overview

This is a feature-rich Task Management System designed for small teams, built with Next.js (frontend), NestJS (backend), and MongoDB (database). The application allows users to create, assign, track, and manage tasks efficiently with a clean, responsive interface.

## Approach and Design Decisions

1. **Authentication**: Implemented JWT-based auth with secure password hashing using bcrypt. Refresh tokens are used for session management.

2. **Real-time Updates**: Used Socket.io for instant notifications when tasks are assigned or updated, providing a seamless collaborative experience.

3. **State Management**: Redux Toolkit was chosen for complex state management needs, especially for real-time updates and user sessions.

4. **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation ensures robust form handling with minimal re-renders.

5. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS utility-first approach enabled rapid development of a fully responsive UI.

6. **Type Safety**: TypeScript was used throughout the stack to catch errors early and improve developer experience.

## Trade-offs and Assumptions

1. **Database**: Chose MongoDB for flexible schema to accommodate evolving task requirements, though PostgreSQL would work equally well.

2. **Authentication**: Implemented email/password auth for simplicity, though OAuth would be better for production.

3. **Performance**: Prioritized developer experience and feature completeness over micro-optimizations.

4. **Testing**: Included basic integration tests but focused more on core functionality due to time constraints.

## Future Improvements

1. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. Implement offline support with PWA capabilities
3. Add customizable notification preferences
4. Enhance analytics with more detailed metrics
5. Implement task dependencies and subtasks
